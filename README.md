## 📂 CodSoft Internship Projects

🚀 This repository contains the projects I completed during my **CodSoft Internship**, focusing on practical implementation of Data Science and Machine Learning concepts. Each task reflects hands-on experience with real-world problem-solving using Python and relevant libraries like **pandas**, **scikit-learn**, **matplotlib**, and **seaborn**.

### 🔧 Technologies Used:
- Python 🐍
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- matplotlib & seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

### 📁 Project Highlights:
- ✅ Logistic Regression vs Random Forest: Accuracy Comparison & Model Selection
- 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on structured datasets
- 🧠 Implementation of ML algorithms from scratch and using libraries
