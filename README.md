## 📂 CodSoft Internship Projects
# Task-1
🚀 This repository contains the projects I completed during my **CodSoft Internship**, focusing on practical implementation of Data Science and Machine Learning concepts. Each task reflects hands-on experience with real-world problem-solving using Python and relevant libraries like **pandas**, **scikit-learn**, **matplotlib**, and **seaborn**.

### 🔧 Technologies Used:
- Python 🐍
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- matplotlib & seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

### 📁 Project Highlights:
- ✅ Logistic Regression vs Random Forest: Accuracy Comparison & Model Selection
- 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on structured datasets
- 🧠 Implementation of ML algorithms from scratch and using libraries

### 📌 About the Internship:
This internship at **CodSoft** provided a platform to apply theoretical knowledge into building end-to-end Machine Learning models. Emphasis was placed on:
- Data cleaning & preprocessing
- Model training, evaluation, and comparison
- Result interpretation & visualization
# Task-3
# Regression Model Evaluation

This project involves building and evaluating a regression model to predict a continuous target variable. The model's performance has been assessed using standard regression error metrics and visualization.

## 📊 Model Evaluation Metrics

| Metric                        | Value                 |
|------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Sum of Squared Errors (SSE)  | 158.16                |
| Mean Squared Error (MSE)     | 2.64                  |
| Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)| 1.62                 |
| R² Score (Coefficient of Determination) | 0.867     |

- **SSE (Sum of Squared Errors):** Measures the total squared difference between actual and predicted values.
- **MSE (Mean Squared Error):** Average of the squared errors, showing overall model fit.
- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error):** Interprets error in the same units as the target variable.
- **R² Score:** Indicates that the model explains **86.7%** of the variance in the target data.

## ✅ Conclusion

The regression model demonstrates **strong performance**:

- High **R² value (0.867)** shows a good fit.
- Low **RMSE (1.62)** implies accurate predictions with minimal average error.
- Residual plot confirms that predictions generally align with actual values.



## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Further **feature engineering** or **data scaling** may help reduce residual error.
- Try different regression techniques (e.g., Ridge, Lasso, or Random Forest) for comparison.
- Evaluate cross-validation performance for better generalization.
