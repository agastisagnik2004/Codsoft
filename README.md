- Result interpretation & visualization

# Task-2
# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. The goal is to classify transactions as either legitimate or fraudulent based on a dataset of anonymized credit card transactions.

## Dataset
- The dataset used is `creditcard.csv`, containing transactions made by European cardholders over two days.
- It has 31 columns: `Time`, 28 anonymized features (`V1` to `V28`), `Amount`, and the target variable `Class` (0 = legitimate, 1 = fraud).
- The dataset is highly imbalanced, with fraudulent transactions accounting for a very small fraction of the total.

## Features
- **Time:** Seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction.
- **V1 to V28:** Principal components obtained via PCA to protect sensitive information.
- **Amount:** Transaction amount.
- **Class:** Target variable indicating fraud.

## Installation
To run this project, you need Python and the following libraries installed:
# 'pip install pandas scikit-learn imbalanced-learn'

## Usage
1. Load the dataset (`creditcard.csv`).
2. Preprocess data by scaling the `Time` and `Amount` features.
3. Handle class imbalance using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).
4. Split the data into training and testing sets.
5. Train a Logistic Regression model.
6. Evaluate the model using classification metrics and confusion matrix.

## How to Run
Place the dataset file `creditcard.csv` in the project directory. Then run the main script:
'python credit_card_fraud_detection.py

## Results
The model’s performance is evaluated using precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix. Using SMOTE improves the detection of fraudulent transactions by balancing the dataset.

# Task-3
# Sales Forcasting Model Evaluation

This project involves building and evaluating a regression model to predict a continuous target variable. The model's performance has been assessed using standard regression error metrics and visualization.

## 📊 Model Evaluation Metrics

| Metric                        | Value                 |
|------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Sum of Squared Errors (SSE)  | 158.16                |
| Mean Squared Error (MSE)     | 2.64                  |
| Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)| 1.62                 |
| R² Score (Coefficient of Determination) | 0.867     |

- **SSE (Sum of Squared Errors):** Measures the total squared difference between actual and predicted values.
- **MSE (Mean Squared Error):** Average of the squared errors, showing overall model fit.
- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error):** Interprets error in the same units as the target variable.
- **R² Score:** Indicates that the model explains **86.7%** of the variance in the target data.

## ✅ Conclusion

The regression model demonstrates **strong performance**:

- High **R² value (0.867)** shows a good fit.
- Low **RMSE (1.62)** implies accurate predictions with minimal average error.
- Residual plot confirms that predictions generally align with actual values.



## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Further **feature engineering** or **data scaling** may help reduce residual error.
- Try different regression techniques (e.g., Ridge, Lasso, or Random Forest) for comparison.
- Evaluate cross-validation performance for better generalization.
